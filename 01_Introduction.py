NLTK - Natural Language Tool Kit.

$$  Introduction

Text-based communication has become one of the most common forms of expression. 
We email, text message, tweet, and update our statuses on a daily basis. As a 
result, unstructured text data has become extremely common, and analyzing large 
quantities of text data is now a key way to understand what people are thinking.

Tweets on Twitter help us find trending news topics in the world. Reviews on Amazon 
help users purchase the best-rated products. These examples of organizing and 
structuring knowledge represent Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

NLP is a field of computer science that focuses on the interaction between 
computers and humans. NLP techniques are used to analyze text, providing a 
way for computers to understand human language. A few examples of NLP applications 
include automatic summarization, topic segmentation, and sentiment analysis.

natural language processing (NLP) is about developing applications and services that 
are able to understand human languages.


$$  NLP Implementations :
    
These are some of the successful implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP):

1. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. Google search engine understands that 
   you are a tech guy so it shows you results related to you.

2. Social websites feeds like Facebook news feed. The news feed algorithm 
   understands your interests using natural language processing and shows 
   you related Ads and posts more likely than other posts.
   
3. Speech engines like Apple Siri.

4. Spam filters like Google spam filters. It’s not just about the usual spam 
   filtering, now spam filters understand what’s inside the email content and 
   see if it’s a spam or not.


Basic Steps You need to do :

    1. Download the python -3 version.

    2. Install NLTK module
        - pip install nltk
    
    3. import nltk
        - import nltk
    4. Download all the nltk the data.
        - nltk.download()
        
        After you executed the above command, a popup will appear, 
        download all of them.


This tutorial is made up of from many sources including my own experience 
and covers alomst all basic and most frequest used topics in NLTK.
